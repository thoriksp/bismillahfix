# Deployment & Firebase Setup Guide

## Important references
- Vercel + Vite notes: Vercel docs recommend prefixing env vars with `VITE_` for Vite apps. (See Vercel + Vite docs.)
- Vercel environment variables: add the same keys as in your `.env` (VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY, etc.) in Project Settings > Environment Variables.
- Firebase setup: create a Firebase project, enable Realtime Database and Authentication (Email/Password), and register a web app to get the config keys.
